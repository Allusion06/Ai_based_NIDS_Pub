Problem Statement
Too Much Traffic to Check Manually: Modern networks send millions of data packets every second. It is impossible for humans to check every single log file to find threats.
Attacks are Fast and Dangerous: Cyberattacks, like DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service), happen very quickly. If they are not stopped immediately, they can crash websites and networks.
Need for Automation: Traditional tools often miss hidden attacks. We need a smart system that uses Artificial Intelligence to watch the network 24/7 and automatically spot "bad" traffic.

Who Are The End Users?
Network Administrators: To monitor live traffic and instantly spot system threats.
Security Analysts: To quickly understand attack details using the AI's simple explanations.
Students & Researchers: To use as a learning tool for understanding how Machine Learning stops cyberattacks.
Small Businesses: To protect their websites automatically without needing large security teams.
